/// FROM Stockfish's implementation
/// STL thread library used by mingw and gcc when cross compiling for Windows
/// relies on libwinpthread. Currently libwinpthread implements mutexes directly
/// on top of Windows semaphores. Semaphores, being kernel objects, require kernel
/// mode transition in order to lock or unlock, which is very slow compared to
/// interlocked operations (about 30% slower on bench test). To work around this
/// issue, we define our wrappers to the low level Win32 calls. We use critical
/// sections to support Windows XP and older versions. Unfortunately, cond_wait()
/// is racy between unlock() and WaitForSingleObject() but they have the same
/// speed performance as the SRW locks.
